# Lab #4: `styled-components`

Your task on this branch is to style our weather application with `styled-components`. Take the styles in `src/global.css`, comment all of them out and get cracking!

As a reminder, this is what the finished app looks like (and should look like after converting it to a different library):

There are no unit tests verifying the correct solutionâ€”if your app looks the same with the moved styles that's it! (note that a 1:1 move might, in some cases, not be possible)
