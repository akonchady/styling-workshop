# `styled-components`

Your task on this branch is to style our weather application with `styled-components`. Take the styles in `public/global.css`, comment all of them out and get cracking!

As a reminder, to see the finished app go to https://styling-workshop.now.sh. This is what the finished app looks like (and should look like after converting it to a different library):

## Next steps

Once you're done styling your app with `styled-components` that's it, you're done with the workshop! Congratulations, I hope you got a bit of an overview on how to style react applications.
