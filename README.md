# Lab #4: Inline styles

Your task on this branch is to style our weather application with inline styles Take the styles in `public/global.css`, comment all of them out and get cracking!

As a reminder, this is what the finished app looks like (and should look like after converting it to inline styles):

There are no unit tests verifying the correct solutionâ€”if your app looks the same with the moved styles that's it! (note that a 1:1 move might, in some cases, not be possible)
